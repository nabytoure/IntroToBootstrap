1. If you want to highlight the current page in main menu then add the class "current" to li. 
2. If the main menu has sub menu then you need to add the class "has_submneu" to li.
3. If you are in sub menu, then you need to add the class "current" & "open" to the "parent li" (the one which has "has_submenu" class). Then you need to add class "active" to the current page li.
